Welcome to My Blackjack Game Repository!

× Overview : 

This project is a result of a deep dive into JavaScript, where I've turned a simple implementation of a Blackjack game and transformed it into a more robust, playable, and realistic version that can be experienced directly through an HTML page. 
This is developed from scratch, without following tutorials or copying existing code snippets. Extensive documentation and video explanations of core JavaScript concepts were my main tools to achieving this personal project. 
The BlackJack game is the representation of three intensive weeks of JavaScript self-learning, starting from virtually no coding experience.  


× Features : 

- A relatively comprehensive and realistic Blackjack game.
- Consideration of edge cases and dynamic value attribution.
- Playable through a user-friendly HTML interface.


× Contributing : 

I'm open to improvements and constructive feedback. Feel free to explore and enhance the code.
